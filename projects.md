### 1. Adversarial Machine Learning

* Exploring the vulnerability of machine learning mdoels to adverarial attacks under both black-box and white-box settings. 

* Defense machine learning models against adversarial attacks.

* Improving adversarial training as a defense technique for model robustness.

* Model interpretation and understanding.

* Image, video, text, audio adversarial examples.

* From Lp-bounded to unrestricted adversarial perturbations.

### 2. Robust Supervised/Weakly-Supervised Learning

* Learning with noisy/adversarial labels. 

* Learning with input noise.

* Learning with adversarial back-door/trojan attacks.

* Learning in noisy and dynamic real-world environments.
